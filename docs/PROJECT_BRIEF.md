# Project Brief: Amer Kallajo Portfolio Hub

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a visually stunning, futuristic one-screen portfolio hub that serves as a digital gateway to Amer Kallajo's creative work. The site functions as a "Linktree on steroids" – a premium, animated landing experience that immediately captivates visitors and directs them to specific portfolio sections.

The primary purpose is to provide a memorable, frictionless way for exhibition attendees (scanning a QR code) to explore Amer's work and make contact.
